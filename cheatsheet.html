<br>
<h2> Unit 1: Computers </h2>
<h3> Definitions and Terms </h3>
<ul>
<li> Computer - Something that has inputs, outputs, and storage</li>
<li> Processor (CPU) -  This is the brain of the computer that does all of the calculations </li>
<li> Motherboard - Connects all elements to each other, holds USB and expansion card ports, determines size of computer.</li>
<li> Case - Holds all components, mainly cosmetic.</li>
<li> Graphics Card (GPU) - Processor designed to handle graphics, you hook up the monitor to it.</li>
<li> RAM - Stands for random access memory, can buy more of it for the computer, think "short term" memory.</li>
<li> Hard Drive - Stores all data, "long term" memory. Includes SSD's (solid state drives) that are faster.</li> 
<li> Optical Drive - Allows the computer to read CD's and other things. </li>
<li> Power Supply - Directs electricity to other components. More speed = more power needed.</li>
<li> Inputs - data being put into the computer by peripherals</li> 
<li> Outputs - The 'feedback' that you are receiving from the computer</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3> Facts from the Test </h3>
<ul>
<li> A computer is: Electronic device that stores information </li>
<li> What information is held in RAM?: What is on the screen </li>
<li> Is a camera a computer?: Yes because there is a input and there is a output, it also has storage.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Unit 2: Data </h2>
<h3> Definitions and Terms</h3>
<ul>
<li> Analog - infinite amount of data, rounded waves, can be sampled, represented as an analogy </li>
<li> Digital - finite amount of data, square waves, can be packaged as binary bits</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3> Test Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li> The OSI model was created by: A Multinational Organization</li>
<li> All digital data is: Quantized</li>
<li> How does the OSI model keep messages secret?: Encryption/Decryption & Packaging </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2> Unit 3: Binary and Algorithms</h2>
<h3> Definitions and Terms</h3>
<ul>
<li> Algorithm - An algorithm is a series of logical steps to solve a problem. These steps are machine readable.</li>
<li> Binary - Base 2 system, 1's represent "on" while 0's represent "off"</li>
<li> Decimal - Base 10 system, uses numbers like 223 or 563</li>
<li> Greedy Algorithm - An algorithm that takes the extremes first then the middle values</li>
<li> Linear Search - Goes down the list until required element is found</li>
<li> Binary Search - Needs a <strong> sorted list </strong>, takes a element and cuts the list in half depending on relative value</li>
<li> Processing Time - Number of comparisons made or steps taken to get the desired result<li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3> Test Questions </h3>
<ul>
<li> Example of a non-computer based algorithm: making a sandwich</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2> Unit 4: The Web and HTML </h2>
<h3> Definitions and Terms </h3>
<ul>
<li> p - Adds text to the website</li>
<li> li - List item</li>
<li> style - Allows CSS to be used</li>
<li> strong - Bolds text </li>
<li> emp - Italicizes text  </li>
<li> div - Assigns a class label</li>
<li> CSS - Cascading style sheets</li>
<li> HTML - Hyper text markup language</li>
<li> H1 to h6 - Determines heading size for headers</li>
<li> tr - Table row</li>
<li> td - Table cell</li>
</ul>
<br> 
<h3> Test Questions </h3>
<ul>
<li> How can Notepad++ files be available on the web?: Saved as .html file and uploaded to Github or another <strong> server</strong></li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2> Unit 5: Javascript</h2>
<h3> Definitions and Terms</h3>
<ul>
<li> var x =  - Makes a variable</li>
<li> shapes - Ellipse, triangle, line, rectangle, quadrilateral, etc.</li>
<li> Fill - Fills in shape or background with color </li>
<li> Mouse X and Y - Tells the position of the mouse. Can be used as a variable </li>
<li> Function - Repeats / re draws action over and over. some times makes little changes</li>
<li> If/ Else/ for - Has conditions that must be met in order to run code.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3> Don't forget about OSI and Sorting Algorithm projects!</h3>
<h2> Good Luck! </h2>
